## Overview
- The goal of this project was to build a simple, visually appealing QR code component that follows the given design.
This project is fully responsive and adapts well to both mobile and desktop screens without requiring additional media queries.
# CHALLENGES FACED
* Centering the QR code component properly on the page
* Styling the component to match the given design as possible.
* Styling the component to match the given design as closely as possible.
# Additional Features
To make my project stand out, I included the following enhancements:

- Box Shadow: Added a subtle shadow to give the QR code card a more  modern and elevated look.
- Hover Effect: Applied a hover scale-up effect to make the QR code component interactive.
- Alternative Link: Included an accessible text link for users who might not be able to scan the QR code.
- Themed Background: Styled the background with a soft pattern of tech-related icons to reinforce the project's theme.
- Positioning Adjustments: Ensured the icons blend smoothly into the background without overlapping key content.
